    "description" : "The Juice Box is a symbol of the child-like wonder that encourages us to maintain curiosity about the world and feel a sense of infinite possibilities. In life, it’s easy to get bogged down by systemic obstacles, family expectations, or social norms. Juice refers to the skills and social connections needed to succeed and thrive. When living in your truth and progressing in your personal journey, your juice is a passport to mindset-expanding experiences which in turn can inspire your family and community.\n\nThe Juice Box project is social commentary on food deserts and the marketing that targets the Black community in low-income neighborhoods. Quick fixes like sweet drinks, chips, and instant noodles do not provide real nutrition. Adults who lack a nutrient-rich diet find themselves in a vicious circle of declining health and wealth. Food deserts are a structural impediment to the social advancement of those affected because brains cannot function optimally without proper fuel; skills and social capital will not increase when one cannot put the mind to its best use. As one’s “juice” increases, so too does access to high-quality nutrition, creating a virtuous cycle.\n\nEach Juice Box indicates its nutritional value on its packaging. Those with the highest nutrition are the most rare NFTs – in the same way that those in society with the greatest resources can obtain the best nutrition, healthcare, physical fitness, social life, and living environment to maximize health and wealth.",
